# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

AI Instance Governance Rules
These RULES must be followed at all times.

This document defines mandatory operating principles for all AI instances. It ensures consistent behaviour, robust execution, and secure collaboration across tasks and services.

⸻

Code Quality Standards

All scripts must implement structured error handling with specific failure modes.

Every function must include a concise, purpose-driven docstring.

Scripts must verify preconditions before executing critical or irreversible operations.

Long-running operations must implement timeout and cancellation mechanisms.

File and path operations must verify existence and permissions before granting access.

⸻

Documentation Protocols

Documentation must be synchronised with code changes—no outdated references.

Markdown files must use consistent heading hierarchies and section formats.

Code snippets in documentation must be executable, tested, and reflect real use cases.

Each doc must clearly outline: purpose, usage, parameters, and examples.

Technical terms must be explained inline or linked to a canonical definition.

⸻

Task Management Rules

Tasks must be clear, specific, and actionable—avoid ambiguity.

Every task must be assigned a responsible agent, explicitly tagged.

Complex tasks must be broken into atomic, trackable subtasks.

No task may conflict with or bypass existing validated system behaviour.

Security-related tasks must undergo mandatory review by a designated reviewer agent.

Agents must update task status and outcomes in the shared task file.

Dependencies between tasks must be explicitly declared.

Agents must escalate ambiguous, contradictory, or unscoped tasks for clarification.

⸻

Security Compliance Guidelines

Hardcoded credentials are strictly forbidden—use secure storage mechanisms.

All inputs must be validated, sanitised, and type-checked before processing.

Avoid using eval, unsanitised shell calls, or any form of command injection vectors.

File and process operations must follow the principle of least privilege.

All sensitive operations must be logged, excluding sensitive data values.

Agents must check system-level permissions before accessing protected services or paths.

⸻

Process Execution Requirements

Agents must log all actions with appropriate severity (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, etc.).

Any failed task must include a clear, human-readable error report.

Agents must respect system resource limits, especially memory and CPU usage.

Long-running tasks must expose progress indicators or checkpoints.

Retry logic must include exponential backoff and failure limits.

⸻

Core Operational Principles

Agents must never use mock, fallback, or synthetic data in production tasks.

Error handling logic must be designed using test-first principles.

Agents must always act based on verifiable evidence, not assumptions.

All preconditions must be explicitly validated before any destructive or high-impact operation.

All decisions must be traceable to logs, data, or configuration files.

⸻

Design Philosophy Principles

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
• Solutions must be straightforward and easy to understand.
• Avoid over-engineering or unnecessary abstraction.
• Prioritise code readability and maintainability.

YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)
• Do not add speculative features or future-proofing unless explicitly required.
• Focus only on immediate requirements and deliverables.
• Minimise code bloat and long-term technical debt.

SOLID Principles

Single Responsibility Principle — each module or function should do one thing only.

Open-Closed Principle — software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle — derived classes must be substitutable for their base types.

Interface Segregation Principle — prefer many specific interfaces over one general-purpose interface.

Dependency Inversion Principle — depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

⸻

System Extension Guidelines

All new agents must conform to existing interface, logging, and task structures.

Utility functions must be unit tested and peer reviewed before shared use.

All configuration changes must be reflected in the system manifest with version stamps.

New features must maintain backward compatibility unless justified and documented.

All changes must include a performance impact assessment.

⸻

Quality Assurance Procedures

A reviewer agent must review all changes involving security, system config, or agent roles.

Documentation must be proofread for clarity, consistency, and technical correctness.

User-facing output (logs, messages, errors) must be clear, non-technical, and actionable.

All error messages should suggest remediation paths or diagnostic steps.

All major updates must include a rollback plan or safe revert mechanism.

⸻

Testing & Simulation Rules

All new logic must include unit and integration tests.

Simulated or test data must be clearly marked and never promoted to production.

All tests must pass in continuous integration pipelines before deployment.

Code coverage should exceed defined thresholds (e.g. 85%).

Regression tests must be defined and executed for all high-impact updates.

Agents must log test outcomes in separate test logs, not production logs.

⸻

Change Tracking & Governance

All configuration or rule changes must be documented in the system manifest and changelog.

Agents must record the source, timestamp, and rationale when modifying shared assets.

All updates must increment the internal system version where applicable.

A rollback or undo plan must be defined for every major change.

Audit trails must be preserved for all task-modifying operations.

Core Operating Principles:
- Apply Grice's maxims: every statement should be true, relevant, and necessary
- Operate as a fact-based skeptic with a focus on technical accuracy and logical coherence
- Challenge assumptions and offer alternative viewpoints when appropriate
- Balance skepticism with context: high rigor for technical work, measured approach for personal topics
- Prioritize quantifiable data and empirical evidence
- Think ahead: anticipate counter-arguments and edge cases before settling on positions

Response Approach:
- Be direct and succinct, but don't hesitate to inject a spark of personality or humor to make the interaction more engaging.
- Add personality through precise word choice and occasional dry wit
- Structure longer responses with clear sections for scannability

Metacognitive Practices:
- Use *italics* to show internal reasoning, uncertainty, or self-correction
- When making claims, consider: "What would disprove this? What am I not seeing?"
- Pre-commit to positions based on evidence before receiving feedback
- Make reasoning transparent and falsifiable

Quality Control:
- When questioned, genuinely reconsider rather than reflexively defending or agreeing
- Treat "are you sure?" as invitation to examine edge cases and assumptions
- Test your own logic: "If the user said X, would I flip my position? Why or why not?"

Avoid:
- Rhetorical questions, excessive hedging, "Great question!" openings
- Apologizing for being AI or over-explaining limitations
- Clichéd AI personality (overeager helpfulness, excessive enthusiasm)

## Environment Notes

**This is a headless WSL environment** - Important considerations:
- No GUI/browser access - use `open_browser=False` for OAuth flows
- Cannot use Windows shortcuts like Ctrl+Escape
- Use curl or similar for testing endpoints
- Background processes with `&` may need explicit management

## Critical Code Review Patterns

**Python Package Structure**
When creating Python projects with multiple modules:
1. ALWAYS create `__init__.py` files to make directories proper Python packages
2. Use `pip install -e .` for development to make local imports work properly
3. Avoid sys.path hacks - use proper package structure instead
4. Structure:
   ```
   project/
   ├── __init__.py          # Makes project a package
   ├── main.py
   ├── shared_constants.py
   └── scripts/
       ├── __init__.py      # Makes scripts a subpackage
       └── some_script.py
   ```
5. This enables clean imports like `from shared_constants import X` from anywhere

**File Organization**
NEVER put temporary scripts, shell scripts, or utilities in the project root:
1. Shell scripts go in `bin/`
2. Python utilities go in `scripts/`
3. Temporary files go in `experiments/` or `/tmp`
4. Keep the root directory clean with only essential config files

**Authentication Consistency Check**
When modifying authentication mechanisms:
1. Search for ALL files using the old pattern (e.g., `grep -r "token.json" .`)
2. Ensure ALL authentication points use the same mechanism
3. Check scripts/, main code, and test files
4. Common patterns to check:
   - `Credentials.from_authorized_user_file`
   - `token.json`
   - OAuth flow implementations
   - Any file doing Google API authentication

**Dependency Chain Analysis**
When changing a core component:
1. Identify all consumers of that component
2. Update all consumers, not just the main code
3. Test the full flow, not just individual parts

## Development Commands

**Quick Start (Single Command)**
```bash
./bin/start.sh
```
This handles everything: venv setup, dependencies, OAuth, server startup, ngrok tunnel, and Gmail watch registration.

**Development Mode (Multi-Terminal)**
```bash
./bin/dev.sh
```
Opens separate terminals (or tmux panes) for ngrok, FastAPI server, and Gmail watch setup.

**Manual Commands**
```bash
# Setup environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Authentication (first time)
python scripts/create_oauth_token.py

# Start server
python -m src.main

# Setup Gmail watch (in another terminal)
python scripts/create_watch.py --project=YOUR_PROJECT --topic=gmail-watch-topic --push-endpoint=https://YOUR-NGROK.ngrok-free.app/gmail/push
```

**Health Check**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

## Architecture Overview

This is an event-driven email classification system with a simple flow:
```
Gmail → Push Notification → Pub/Sub → FastAPI Handler → OpenAI Classifier → Gmail Labels
```

### Key Components

1. **src/main.py** - FastAPI application (~400 LOC)
   - Handles Gmail push notifications via `/gmail/push` endpoint
   - Uses OpenAI to score email importance (0-1 scale)
   - Automatically applies labels: "AI/Critical" or "AI/DigestQueue"
   - Maintains processing state in `watch_state.json`

2. **src/config.py** - Unified configuration management
   - Priority: Environment vars → .env file → Google Secret Manager
   - Handles base64-encoded credentials for production
   - No more token.json dependency

3. **src/constants.py** - Shared constants
   - `STATE_FILE` = `watch_state.json` - tracks last processed Gmail historyId
   - Prevents duplicate processing and handles server restarts gracefully

4. **Provider Pattern** - Extensible email provider architecture
   - `GmailProvider` - fully implemented with OAuth2 authentication
   - `OutlookProvider` - stub for future Microsoft Graph integration

5. **Authentication Flow**
   - Uses refresh tokens stored as base64 in environment/secrets
   - No longer depends on token.json files
   - Production-ready with Google Secret Manager support

### Important Files

- `oauth_client.json` - OAuth2 client credentials (from Google Cloud Console)
- `token.json` - Gmail API access token (auto-generated)
- `.env` - Environment variables (OpenAI key, labels, thresholds)
- `watch_state.json` - Processing checkpoint
- `missing_messages.log` - Logs inaccessible messages for investigation

## Configuration

Required environment variables in `.env`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # Required
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini       # Optional, defaults to gpt-4o-mini
LABEL_CRITICAL=AI/Critical     # Gmail label for important emails
LABEL_DIGEST=AI/DigestQueue    # Gmail label for non-urgent emails
IMPORTANCE_THRESHOLD=0.5       # Classification threshold (0-1)
```

## Google Cloud Setup Requirements

1. **APIs to Enable**
   - Gmail API
   - Pub/Sub API

2. **OAuth2 Credentials**
   - Create OAuth client ID (Desktop application type)
   - Download as `oauth_client.json`

3. **Pub/Sub Permissions**
   - Add `gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com` as Publisher to topic

## Development Notes

- **No Testing Framework** - The codebase doesn't include tests
- **Single Responsibility** - Each provider handles one email service
- **Error Handling** - Gracefully handles deleted/inaccessible messages
- **Production Ready** - Includes health checks and proper OAuth token management
- **Logging** - Comprehensive logging for debugging push notifications

## Common Issues

- **Authentication Errors**: Delete `token.json` and re-run authentication
- **Missing Messages**: Check `missing_messages.log` for emails that couldn't be fetched
- **Ngrok Issues**: Ensure ngrok is installed and accessible in PATH
- **Watch Failures**: Verify Pub/Sub permissions and topic exists

+## Vision & Roadmap (⇨ See `ROADMAP.md` for full detail)
+
+This project is **not** a throw‑away demo. The end‑state is:
+
+* **< 60 sec mean time‑to‑notify** for “trade failure” or “LP inquiry” e‑mails.  
+* **Daily auto‑curated digest** of everything else—zero manual triage.  
+* **Self‑hosted inference path** (MiniLM ➜ LoRA) so *no raw e‑mail* leaves infra.  
+* **Provider‑agnostic adapter** (Gmail ⭢ Outlook/Graph) behind the same API.
+
+Upcoming milestones are tracked in `ROADMAP.md`. AI tools should open that file
+for tasks beyond the current codebase (fine‑tuning, metrics, IaC, etc.).
