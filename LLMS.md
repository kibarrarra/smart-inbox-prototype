## Session: 2025-06-17 - Email Classification Enhancement

### Key Developments

**Enhanced Email Classification System**
- **Problem**: Basic binary classification (critical/digest) was too simplistic
- **Solution**: Implemented 4-tier intelligent labeling system:
  - **Critical** (0.8+ score): "AI/Critical" - Trade failures, margin calls, system outages
  - **Urgent** (0.5+ score): "AI/Urgent" - Business communications, client meetings
  - **Medium** (0.4+ score): "AI/Medium" - Reports, vendor communications
  - **Digest** (<0.4 score): "AI/DigestQueue" - Newsletters, personal emails

**Improved Classification Prompt**
- **Before**: Simple "hedge-fund PM" context with binary scoring
- **After**: Detailed rubric with examples for each priority tier
- **Result**: More nuanced scoring (e.g., newsletters now score 0.10 instead of 0.00)
- **Technical**: Increased max_tokens from 4 to 8, temperature from 0.0 to 0.1 for stability

**Code Architecture Improvements**
- **Provider Pattern**: Updated `EmailProvider.label_message()` to accept float score instead of boolean
- **Settings**: Added configurable thresholds (`urgent_threshold=0.8`, `medium_threshold=0.4`)
- **Error Handling**: Added score clamping to 0.0-1.0 range for robustness

### Testing Results
- **Classification Accuracy**: 100% on test suite (6 diverse email types)
- **Score Range**: Proper distribution across 0.0-1.0 scale
- **Performance**: ~1.5 seconds per email classification

### Technical Insights
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** performs excellently for email triage with structured prompts
- **Context specificity** (finance examples) significantly improves accuracy
- **Multi-tier labeling** provides better user experience than binary classification
- **Score-based approach** enables flexible threshold tuning without prompt changes

### Next Optimization Areas
1. **Real-world validation** - Test with actual Gmail inbox
2. **Prompt A/B testing** - Compare different context frameworks
3. **Performance monitoring** - Track classification accuracy over time
4. **Domain adaptation** - Extend beyond finance to general business use

### Authentication Debugging Discovery
**Issue**: Gmail OAuth refresh token was revoked (not expired)
**Root Cause**: `invalid_grant` error indicates token revocation, not expiration
**Diagnostic Tool**: Created `debug_gmail_auth.py` for systematic OAuth troubleshooting

**Key Learnings**:
- Refresh tokens can be revoked independently of expiration
- Manual token refresh testing bypasses Google client library abstractions
- Direct API calls reveal exact OAuth error codes and descriptions
- Common causes: user revoked permissions, OAuth app changes, compliance issues

**Production Insight**: Authentication systems need robust error handling for token revocation scenarios, not just expiration handling.

## Session: 2025-06-21 - Authentication Resolution & Full System Verification

### Authentication Issue Resolution
**Problem**: Gmail OAuth refresh token was revoked, causing `invalid_grant` errors
**Root Cause**: Token in Secret Manager was 10 days old and had been revoked
**Solution**: Generated fresh OAuth token using `scripts/get_refresh_token.py` and updated Secret Manager

**Key Discovery**: Secret Manager integration was working correctly - the issue was token revocation, not configuration

### Full System Verification
**Gmail Integration**: ✅ Working - Connected to kevin.a.ibarra@gmail.com (119,191 messages)
**Classification System**: ✅ Working - Scoring trade failure as 1.00 (Critical)
**4-Tier Labeling**: ✅ Working - Critical/Urgent/Medium/Digest labels properly assigned
**Server Health**: ✅ Working - FastAPI endpoints responding correctly

### Technical Insights
- **Secret Manager Priority**: System correctly prioritizes Secret Manager over environment variables
- **Token Refresh Flow**: OAuth tokens can be revoked independently of expiration dates
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Custom debugging scripts revealed exact credential sources and validation status
- **Headless OAuth**: `get_refresh_token.py` works in WSL/headless environments with manual URL handling

### System Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL
The intelligent email labeling prototype is ready for real-world Gmail integration and live email processing.
